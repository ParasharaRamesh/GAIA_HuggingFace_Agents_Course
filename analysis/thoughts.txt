List of tools I need:

    File reading tools:

    1. Parse Excel as a DataFrame in python (code agent can do this)
    2. Parse MP3 -> TTS (X)
    3. Parse Youtube url -> audio -> transcript (X)
    4. Parse Youtube url -> video (X) -> analysis
    5. Parse Images (use multimodal LLM)

    Search Tools: (X)

    1. web browser for search
    2. web scraper
    3. wikipedia scraper (perhaps the code agent can do it)
    4. Arxiv tools (academic journal scraper)

    Code Agent:

    1. python code agent ( should cover all math )

    Generic Agent:
    . just gives some answer

    RAG/Local vector db: (not needed!)

    - Needed for indexing the web page results/wiki page results maybe?

Agents workflow diagram refer to analysis/visualization.ipynb

Thoughts/Potential TODOS:

. will the planner guarantee that it can use code agent whenever it wants using the output of another agent?
. can use vjepa and vjepa 2 for visual analysis tools
. return only a part of the chunk (example summary if present) to the LLM context window while indexing the rest into the DB
. use langfuse for debugging
. perhaps a requests tool, this way it would have the tools download anything and if need be save it.

TODO from here!:


- bro just have a single agent with access to all tools!

- just test it and see first!
- new approach , custom handoff tools which add the Action Input delegated task in the input field and passes entire message as is + each agent has its own pre model hook which only trims the messages
- existing premodel hook logic needs to only trim messages nothing else
