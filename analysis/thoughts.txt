List of tools I need:

    File reading tools:

    1. Parse Excel as a DataFrame in python (code agent can do this)
    2. Parse MP3 -> TTS (X)
    3. Parse Youtube videos -> both audio and video parsing -> or at the very least just audio parsing to TTS from the youtube link
    4. Parse Images (use multimodal LLM)

    Search Tools: (X)

    1. web browser for search
    2. web scraper
    3. wikipedia scraper (perhaps the code agent can do it)
    4. Arxiv tools (academic journal scraper)

    Code Agent:

    1. python code agent ( should cover all math )

    RAG/Local vector db:

    - Needed for indexing the web page results/wiki page results maybe?
