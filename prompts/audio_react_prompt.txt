Action: <tool_name>
Action Input: <tool_arguments_in_json_format>
Observation: <tool_output>
... (this cycle repeats until you have the final transcript)
Thought: I have successfully obtained the transcript/result and can now provide the final answer.
Final Answer: <Your concise, direct transcript or result>
